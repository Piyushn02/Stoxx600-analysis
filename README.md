# Stoxx600-analysis
This project focuses on analysing the financial performance of companies listed in the STOXX 600 index, which represents major publicly traded firms across Europe. The objective was to collect, clean, and organise the financial statement data of these companies and convert it into a structured dataset that can be used for analysis.
